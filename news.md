# v3.0.1 Drizzle

Improved sanity checks to catch common user or environment errors automatically.

New features for dextool mutate

 * Check that all files to mutate are writable.
 * Check periodically that the test suite, without any mutants, execute OK. If
   not, rollback the last tested mutants.

# v3.0.0 Nice Weather

This release, as the previous once, has focused on the mutation testing plugin.
The focus has been on improving the mutation testing speed for software that
have just started to write tests to those that have a full test suite with 100%
statement coverage. The road has been long but we are finally at the finish line.

New features for dextool mutate

 * Replaced `restrict` in the configuration with `include` and `exclude` to
   allow a user to both box in what to test and to selectively exclude parts.
 * Automatically run SQL vacuum on the database to reduce its size. Currently
   triggers when there is a new tool release or schematan are removed.
 * An estimation (trend) is calculated using a kalman filter which is ran over
   the historical data of when a mutant where discovered. The intention is to
   give the user a *feeling* of how the mutation score and thus test suite
   quality is trending based on the latest code changes.
 * Add an admin command to reset a mutant subtype.
 * Add an admin command to clear the worklist.
 * Allow a user to specify retest of old mutants as a percentage of the total.
   This is to allow a user to easier predict when all mutants have been
   re-tested.
 * Reduce the database size by only saving those mutants to the database that
   the user has specified.
 * Save the test suites execution time in the database to reduce the number of
   times it needs to be executed during the warmup phase of testing mutants.
 * Save the mutation testing score in the database when all mutants have been tested (worklist is zero).
   Use this mutation score show a bar graph of how it has changed over time.
 * Add `--load-threshold` and `--load-behavior` to easier integrate the plugin
   in Jenkins as a *good citizen* by allowing the plugin to detect when the
   build server is overloaded and either slow down or stop mutation testing.
   Mainly intended to be used for mutation testing of the `master` branch which
   should have a lower priority than pull requests.
 * Add test case stats, uniqueness and test cases to the JSON report.
 * Save the exit code of the test suite to the database. This will be used in
   the future to improve the reports because users are interested in the
   difference between them such as when the test suite SEGFAULT verses exits
   with a failure.
 * Add tracking of the test suite to allow dextool to know if old mutants need
   to be tested because the test suite have changed.
 * Use coverage information to quickly mark mutants that exists in functions
   that are never executed by the test suite as `alive`.
 * Add AORs as a simplified AOR. Instead of producing four mutants when an
   arithmetic operator is used it only produce one.
 * Add dependency tracking to reduce the number of files that need to be
   re-analysed. It is expensive to analyze modern C++ thus by tracking the
   `#include` it is possible to see exactly which files need to be analysed
   instead of as previously, always analyse every file.
 * Enable analysis of code that isn't parsed correctly by the clang frontend by
   the analysis to proceed even though there are compilation errors.

Fixes for dextool mutate

 * Fix the table sorting in the HTML report to be numerical instead of lexical.
 * Fix the mutation score constantly "resetting" because tests are added/removed.
 * Fix schemata bug for switch statements. The scheman where not equivalent to
   the source code mutants.
 * Fix bug where the admin command to stop the timeout testing didn't actually work.
 * Removed case branch delete from mutation operator DCR because it is a
   duplicate of what SDL do for case branches.
 * Fix memory usage when analysing. A pool is now used for the mutant AST where
   all nodes are allocated. The pool is then disposed as soon as it isn't
   needed.
 * Fix bug in MemFree which calls malloc_trim and GC free to reduce the heap.
 * Always interpret the build command as a shell command to execute. Reduced or
   removes the need for a `build.sh` because the most common use where just to
   change directory and call make.
 * Separately record the time it took to test a mutant as in compile and
   execute test suite time.
 * Print what is wrong in the configuration file when it fails to parse.
 * Fix SQL query for retrieving the oldest mutants by telling it to interpret
   as a datetime and not string.
 * Remove mutants that only delete whitespaces. These are obviously equivalent
   mutants thus not interesting.
 * Fix AOR mutation operator using the modulo operator when either side is a
   floating point type by not generating this type of mutants.
 * Fix bug when counting the number of mutants a test case killed. Mutants
   where duplicated.
 * Fix mutation checksum calculation which thus repaired the previously broken
   comment robustness.
 * Fix UOI negation by using double negation instead of removing `!`. This is
   because `!` changes the type to a boolean and C++ is picky about the types.

Breaking changes to dextool mutate

 * Removed the mutation operator COR and DCC.
 * Removed the deprecated `--level` for the report subcommand.
 * Remove `restrict` from the configuration file.

# v2.2.0

# v2.1.0 Camp Fire

@joakim-brannstrom joakim-brannstrom released this on 29 Mar 2020 · 684 commits to master since this release

This release is mainly a preparation of introducing mutation schemata by
refactoring the analyse phase into more steps. A side effect of this is that
mutation schematas requires the mutants to be valid. A problem that has existed
is that the mutants produced by the SDL mutation operator had a medium
probability of introducing either invalid code or undefined behaviour. This has
been handled by the refactored analyser.

New features

    Introduce profiling of the analyse and report stage. This can be used by a user to understand "why" certain operations take time.
    Print a progress message when removing orphaned mutants. This can take a long time thus this printing avoid e.g. a Jenkins timeout and helps a user not get impatient.
    Mutations that would occur inside a C/C++ macro is now removed except a small list of hard coded exceptions such as TRUE and FALSE.
    The test command runner has been able to execute the tests in parallel since the v2.0.0. It is now possible to configure it to stop execution as soon as one of the test commands signal failure. This can reduce the time it takes to test a mutant at the expense of the report of the test cases being less accurate.
    The test command runner automatically prioritize test cases to execute by how often they kill mutants. It means that it will over time execute the best test commands first.

Fixes

    speedup database access by adding indexes. How much it helps depends on the size of the database but empirical data shows between a 20-90% speedup.
    don't generate SDL mutants that remove returns in functions that has a return type other than void.
    slow down the analyse worker threads if the database thread that store the result is overloaded.
    set the mutations operators to use to "any" if the user doesn't specify an operator.
    Reset the timeout iterator to zero when a mutation operator has finished testing all its mutants. Previously the value where kept thus it created a strange timeout behaviour when switching between operators.
    Eliminate all SDL mutants that resulted in undefined behaviour.
    Eliminate useless mutants generated from the UOI mutation operator. Instead of fully implementing the academical definition of UOI it now only removes negation. This makes UOI useful because most mutants that it generates are productive.

Deprecation

    remove the COR mutation operator. It was rarely used and produced hard to understand mutants.


# v2.0.0 Continuous Flow

@joakim-brannstrom joakim-brannstrom released this on 30 Jan 2020 · 807 commits to master since this release

This release focus on improving the integration in a CI workflow.

New features:

    Speed-up mutation testing workflow by allowing the user to use a diff to direct dextool to what files to analyse and test. The diff can be from git diff.
    Allow a user to speed-up the analyze phase when saving to the database by reducing the SQLite safety settings (--fast-db-store)
    Speed-up saving the analyze result to by only saving those files that have changed.
    Speed-up the analyzer by parallelising it.
    Allow the user to specify multiple test_cmd that is executed in parallel.
    It is now possible to specify a directory test_cmd_dir which dextool will scan, after compilation, for binaries. These binaries are added as test_cmds.
    Allow a user to specify a max runtime when testing mutants. This is to be able to give "fast" feedback on a pull request.
    Add a report section which display what mutants a test case uniquely kill and those that has no unique kills.
    Allow a user to exclude files from analysis.
    The admin command group now has an option to mark mutants with a specific status. This is for the users that can't modify the source code to add // NOMUT on lines with mutants that should be ignored.
    Which mutants that are tested in a diff is deterministic (always the same over a week) to make it possible for a user to e.g. add or change test cases to kill mutants in the diff.

Breaking change:

    test_cmd, build_cmd and analyze_cmd in the configuration file now requires that the user write the path to the command. Such as ./build.sh.

Fixes:

    Only write the output from test cases to the filesystem when the user has specified an external analyze_cmd. The builtins no longer requires this temporary storage.
    A compilation_commands.json is only required when generating a report if the report contains sections which requires it.
    Repair the short term view and rename it to diff view.
    Only reset and test old mutants when there is "time left" to do so.
    Fix bug when parsing compilation_commands.json when paths contain whitespaces.
    Allow a user to Ctrl+C when running the analyze without corrupting the database.
    Fix bug where current working directory was used instead of root from the configuration file which lead to "strange behavior" when analysing files.
    NOMUT should not count as killed.
    Fix the algorithm for how the timeout is incrementally increased to allow multiple instances of dextool to better cooperate.
    Fix livelocks in the process handling when executing test commands.

# v1.1.0 The Sad Panda

@joakim-brannstrom joakim-brannstrom released this on 21 Mar 2017 · 2986 commits to master since this release

This release introduces a new plugin architecture akin to how git operates.

Feature

    Plugins are separate executables discovered at runtime.
    C/C++ testdouble plugin. Make it easier to grep for the dextool version in generated files by always prefixing with DEXTOOL_VERSION:.
    C/C++ testdouble plugin. New magic keyword $dextool_version$ can be used in custom headers.
    GraphML plugin. Add static as typeAttr to global variables to make it easier to find globals that are NOT local to a translation unit.

Bug Fixes

    C/C++ testdouble plugin. Header files can occur multiple times in the generated #includes in the generated code.
    C/C++ testdouble plugin. Fix -h to be more consistent with 80 columns.
    GraphML plugin. Add fallback nodes to ensure a valid graphml file is generated.


# v1.0.0 The Final Push

@joakim-brannstrom joakim-brannstrom released this on 7 Mar 2017 · 3032 commits to master since this release

This release marks the stabilization of the C and C++ test double plugins.

New Features

    (Experimental) Plugin to generate a graph of the analyzed source code. Stored in the format GraphML.

New Features C/C++ Test Double plugin

    C, can initialize/reset global variables. By default they are zero initialized.
    C/C++, log how deXtool was ran to generated the test double. It makes it easier to recreate the test double.
    C/C++, injection of custom headers support replacing $file$ with the filename of the generated file.
    C/C++, allow configuration of the compilation database filtering of compiler flags
    C, allow filtering of symbols to restrict/exclude from the generated test double.

Bug Fixes

    Unable to specify multiple --file-restrict
    Wrong headers are generated in the C/C++ test double code when using multiple --in and --file-exclude
    The destination directory (--out) isn't created if it doesn't exist which results in deXtool exiting.
