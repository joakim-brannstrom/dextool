# Command Line Options

This document aims to improve usability for the *Mutate* plugin in Dextool by
explaining flags and options in more detail. The following sections are divided
into the current existing commands for *Mutate*.

The flags for the different commands will be listed in the following format:

```sh
--flag-long-version [-flag-short-version]
```
Description

```sh
input_example
```

**Note:** Several of the commands listed below can be set in the
configuration-file as well. It is recommended to generate an *.toml*-file and
set the corresponding fields in that file instead of having long chains of
commands to execute in the terminal (it is usually more simple that way,
reduces clutter in the terminal and increase usability for coming test
sessions). The information listed below can also be viewed by executing
*dextool mutate --help* in a terminal window, but with a shorter and less
detailed explanation.

## General

This options are general and can be used for all the commands in Mutate.

```sh
--config [-c]
```
Load configuration (default: .dextool_mutate.toml). Can be used if another
project contains a configuration-file which the users wants to reuse.


```sh
--db
```
Specify which sqlite3 database to use for the mutation testing (default:
dextool_mutate.sqlite3). This option could be used when several databases
exists for i.e. different versions of the code, or simply because the user have
chosen to create several databases for result.

```sh
--out
```
Path used as the root for mutation/reporting of files (default: .).

```sh
--help [-h]
```
Display the help information in terminal window (less detailed). By writing,
for example, *dextool mutate analyze --help*, the user will display the help
for the analyze command.

### Common

These are options that occur in multiple command groups.

```sh
--include
--exclude
```
Only files that match at least one of the include glob patterns and none of the
exclude will be mutated (written to during the test phase). Default is `"*"` for
include and none for exclude. All patterns are adjusted to be relative to root
(default: .). This option is mostly used by e.g. header only libraries because
dextool need to analyze the test case source code to *see* how the library is
instantiated but the test code should not be mutated. Another use case is when
the root contains source code that shouldn't be mutated then these options make
it possible to specify what inside the root should be mutated.

```sh
# only mutate files under include but exclude test
dextool mutate analyze --include "include/*" --exclude "test/*"
```

```sh
--compile-db
```
Retrieve compilation parameters from a specific compilation-database. This can
be used if the projects contains specific compilation-databases for ex.
compilation targets or environments.

```sh
--diff-from-stdin
```
Reads a diff/patch in the git format (Unified Format) from stdin. It will
always, for all command groups it is available, affect the files and lines that
are tested/reported.

```sh
# only analyze and save mutants in the changed files
git diff|dextool mutate analyze --diff-from-stdin
# only test mutants on the changed lines
git diff|dextool mutate test --diff-from-stdin
# only report mutants on the changed lines
git diff|dextool mutate report --diff-from-stdin
```

```sh
--profile
```
The operations in dextool are not free especially the more complex reports.
This option print a table of what the tool internally spent time on.

```sh
# set logging for all modules
--verbose trace # same as debug
# set logging for a specific module, comma separated
--verbose-module analyze.pass_schema=trace,analyze=trace
```
This option is hidden from normal view. It is used to output specific logging
for an internal submodule. To see all modules run `--verbose-module` with some
nonsense and it will print them.

## Admin

Admin-mode for the plugin. Is used to execute administrative commands and to
initialize/setup mutation testing for a project.


```sh
--init
```
Create an initial configuration to use in the current workspace. This command
is used when the mutation testing is setup for a specific project the first
time.

```sh
--dump-config
```
Dump the detailed configuration in the terminal. Could be used to create and
setup your own configuration-file.

```sh
--operation
```
Administrative operation to perform:
 - *none* : Performs no operation.
 - *resetMutant* : lets the user reset all mutants with the status/state
   specified with *--status* to the status specified with *--to-status*.
 - *removeMutant* : Remove all mutants of the specified kind (*--mutant*) from
   the database.
 - *removeTestCase* : Remove all test cases that match the supplied regex.
 - *markMutant*: Mark a mutant with a specific status and provide a rationale.
   Will both mark the mutant in mutationStatusTable and in a separate table.
 - *removeMarkedMutant* : remove the marking of a mutant.
 - *resetTestCase* : reset the mutants that the test case has killed to unknown (ignore `--to-status`)
 - *compact* : run a sqlite vacuum on the database with the goal of reducing the
   database size. This is automatically done after operations that normally
   result in a potentially significant reduction of the database size so most
   often this option is not needed.
 - *stopTimeoutTest* : changes the states in the database and internal worklists
   such that the test phase will finish the timeout testing faster. This may be
   desired if there are many timeout mutants and it takes a long time to
   execute each of them.
 - *resetMutantSubKind* : same as resetMutant but only operates on the
   sub-mutation kinds which have a higher precision of which ones are affected.
 - *clearWorklist* : clear the worklist of mutants to test.

```sh
--test-case-regex
```
Regular expression to use when removing (*removeTestCase*) or resetting (*resetTestCase*) test cases.

```sh
--status
```
Change mutants with this status/state to the value specified by
*--to-status-flag*. The typical usage of this option is to reset the mutants
with *alive* status to *unknown* in order to conduct mutation testing again
after the test suite has been extended.
 - *unknown* : Mutants that is either untested or caused unknown errors when trying to execute compilation script.
 - *killed* : Mutants that were detected by the test suite (one or more tests failed).
 - *alive* : Mutants that were not detected by the test suite (all tests passed).
 - *killedByCompiler* : Invalid mutants generated that caused the compilation
   of the project to fail.
 - *timeout* : Mutants that timed out during test suite execution.

```sh
--to-status
```
Reset mutants to status/state (default: unknown). (see *--status*).
 - *unknown* : Mutants that is either untested or caused unknown errors when trying to execute compilation script.
 - *killed* : Mutants that were detected by the test suite (one or more tests failed).
 - *alive* : Mutants that were not detected by the test suite (all tests passed).
 - *killedByCompiler* : Invalid mutants generated that caused the compilation of the project to fail.
 - *timeout* : Mutants that timed out during test suite execution.

```sh
--id
```
Specify a specific mutant by Id.

```sh
--rationale
```
Provide a rationale for marking a mutant.

```sh
--mutant-sub-kind
```
The mutation operators are internally divided in 40+ sub categories. This
specify which of them to affect.

## Analyze

Analyze-mode for the plugin. Is used to find mutation points in the project by
traversing the AST for the eligible files. Will write results into a database
that will be used later for testing and generation of mutants.

```sh
--mutant
```
The mutation operators to analyze for and save to the database. This option
strongly affects the test and report phase.

Mutants to operate on.
 - *all* : All mutants are generated.
 - *aor* : Arithmetical Operator Replacement.
 - *dcr* : Decision/Condition Requirement.
 - *lcr* : Logical Connector Replacement.
 - *lcrb* : Logical Connector Replacement (Bit-wise).
 - *ror* : Relational Operator Replacement.
 - *rorp* : Relational Operator Replacement (Pointer).
 - *sdl* : Statement Deletion.
 - *uoi* : Unary Operator Insertion.

```sh
--compile-db
```
Retrieve compilation parameters from a specific compilation-database. This can
be used if the projects contains specific compilation-databases for ex.
compilation targets or environments.

```sh
--in
```
Specific input file to parse. By default, all files in the compilation database
will be analyzed. This is normally only needed for toy examples and dextool
mutates own internal tests.

```sh
--file-include
--file-exclude
```
Only the files that match at least one of the glob include patterns and none of
the exclude will be analyzed. Default is "*" for include and none for exclude.
All patterns are adjusted to be relative to root (default: .).  This option is
good to use to restrict the analysis to only those files that are relevant
because analyzing "redundant" files will take an unnecessary amount of time.
The files that are matched are those in the `compile_commands.json` via
`--compile-db`.

```sh
# to analyze all files under include and src but exclude tests
dextool mutate analyze --file-include "include/*" --file-include "src/*" --file-exclude "src/test/*"
```

```sh
--fast-db-store
```
This de-activates sqlites safety against corrupting a database when it is being
written to. It can speed up the time it takes to save mutants to by 10-100x but
if it is ever interrupted during this process the database will be corrupted.
This is a good option to use on a CI server which keeps backups of the database
but not when using dextool manually, in the console.

```sh
--force-save
```
Normally only changed files are saved to the database. This forces all files to
be saved irregardless if they have changed or not. This may be needed if
`#include`s significantly changes your code base.

```sh
--no-prune
```
The default mode is to remove files and orphaned mutants when they are
detected. This inactivates this by always not running a cleanup phase. This
could be used in combination with `--diff-from-stdin` because only a couple of
files are in the diff. By using `--no-prune` the files that are not changed
will be kept in the database.

```sh
--schemata-mutants
```
Control how many mutants that a schemata at most should contain. The more
mutants a schemata contains the higher is the likelihood that it will fail to
compile.

```sh
--schemata-min-mutants
```
Minimum number of mutants that must exist in a schema for it to be saved and
then later on used in the test phase. It is used to avoid storing "junk"
schemas that actually do not speed up the mutation testing phase.


```sh
--schema-train
```
This option is used to *quickly* train the adaptable scheman on the code base
by only compiling the scheman. By running `analyze` first with `--force-save`
and then `test` with `--schema-train` and `--schema-only` 4-5 times it is
possible to finish a training round in a short time.

```sh
--threads
```
The number of threads to use when analyzing the program. By default as many
threads as there are cores available are used.

## Generate

Generate-mode for the plugin.

```sh
--id
```
Mutate the source code as mutant ID

## Report <a name="report"></a>

Report-mode for the plugin. Is used to generate a result-report at any given
moment (before, after or during mutation testing execution). Can also be used
to generate specific result that helps a user improve test cases among other.

Not all `--section` are supported by all report `--style`s. `plain` supports
all of them. The rest are implemented as needed and if it is feasible.

```sh
--logdir
```
Directory to write log files to (default: .).

```sh
--section
```
Sections to include in the report.

| Section                          | plain | json | html |
|----------------------------------|-------|------|------|
| alive                            | x     | x    |      |

| tc_groups                        |       |      | x    |
| tc_groups_similarity             |       |      | x    |
| tc_killed                        | x     |      |      |
| tc_killed_no_mutants             | x     | x    | (x)  |

| tc_min_set                       |       |      | x    |
| tc_similarity                    |       |      | x    |

| trend                            | x     | x    | x    |

**Note**: styles may have automatic support for sections which are always on,
indicated by a (x)..

**alive**: Only report alive mutants.

**killed**: Only report killed Mutants.

**all_mut**: Report all mutants.

**summary**: A summary of the result such as the mutation score.

**mut_stat**: The top N mutations *from* -> *to* that has survived (e.g. "-" -> "+").

**tc_killed**: The mutants that each test case killed.

**tc_stat**: Test case statistics based on the number of mutants that are killed.

**tc_map**: Deprecated.

**tc_suggestion**: Report per test case alive mutants that are in the same
source code location as mutants the test case are killing.

**tc_killed_no_mutants**: Provide a list of tests that killed no mutant. These
tests are probably flawed.

**tc_full_overlap**: Provide a list of tests that killed the exact same
mutants. They may be redundant and candidates for removal.

**tc_full_overlap_with_mutation_id**: Same as **tc_full_overlap** but include
the mutant too. It makes it possible to do a deeper analysis of test cases.

**tc_groups**: Test case groups.

**tc_min_set**: Provide the minimal set of test cases needed in order to
achieve the mutation score. It can be used to e.g. define a smoke screen test
suite because the minimal set has the same verification coverage as the full
test suite.

**tc_similarity**: Provide a list of tests and to what degree they are similar
in terms of mutants the kill. Use it to e.g. merge tests or remove redundant
test cases.

**tc_groups_similarity**: Compare the similarity between test groups. This is a
"group" view compared to *tc_similarity*.

**mut_recommend_kill**: Report a list of high priority mutants to kill.

**diff**: Add a page that shows the diff as git would do it together with the
mutants on the changed lines.

**tc_unique**: For each test case report the mutants that the test case is the
only one to kill. This can be used in the reverse that test cases that have no
unique mutants may be redundant. Recommended to use in conjunction with
**tc_similarity** for a deeper analysis.

**marked_mutants**: List all manually marked mutants.

**trend**: print the recorded mutation score, one for each day, and a trend of
how it is predicted to change.

```sh
--section-tc_stat-num
```
Number of test cases to report that killed a mutant (will affect the drop-down
in the html-report).

```sh
--section-tc_stat-sort
```
Sort order when reporting test case kill stat.
 - *top* : Sort from top to bottom.
 - *bottom* : Sort from bottom to top.

```sh
--style
```
Kind of report to generate. Lets a user specify if the format of the report.
This could be used if the report is to be pased into an excel-document, or
viewed graphically in the browser etc.
 - *plain* : Generates a plain text summary of the result and prints it in the
   terminal window.
 - *compiler* : Same as *plain* but in compiler-format.
 - *json* : Same as *plain* but in .json-format.
 - *html* : Generates an html-report with all the chosen sections. Is the main
   way of inspect mutation testing result since many of the other commands for
   *Report* is linked to this kind of report. Can be viewed in a browser by
   opening the generated *index.html*-file directly.

## Test

Test-mode for the plugin. Injects a mutant into the source code, compiles the
project to see if the mutants was valid and then executes the test suite in
order to analyze whether or not the test suite detected the mutant. Will also
check if the mutant caused an infinity-loop, or simply took longer time than
usual, by utilizing the timeout-implementation.

```sh
--build-cmd
```
Program/script used to build the application. Will be called to compile both
the original program (sanity check) and to compile the program each time a
mutant is injected.

```sh
--dry-run
```
Do not write mutants to the filesystem. This is intended to be used by dextools
internal tests to fejk mutation testing runs.

```sh
--order
```
Determine in what order mutations are chosen.
 - *random* : Execute the mutations in a random order.
 - *consecutive* : Execute the mutations consecutive by the mutant id.

```sh
--test-cmd
```
Program/script used to run the test suite. Will be called upon by *Mutate* in
order to test the application (both for sanity-checks and when a mutant has
been injected in the code).

```sh
--test-case-analyze-builtin
```
Builtin analyzer of output from testing frameworks to find failing test cases.
Can be used in order to specify a framework used for testing and letting
Dextool analyze the output from test-results according to that framework.
 - *gtest* : Analyzes the test case result according to the Googletest-format.
 - *ctest* : Analyzes the test case result according to the Ctest-format.
 - *makefile* : Analyzes the test case result according to the makefile-format.

```sh
--test-case-analyze-cmd
```
Program/script used to analyze the test execution result. Will be called upon
by *Mutate* in order to analyze the tests for the application (both for
sanity-checks and when a mutant has been injected in the code).

```sh
--test-timeout
```
Timeout to use for the test suite (msecs). This option lets the user manually
set the timeout-limit. It is recommended to let *Mutate* use the builtin
algorithm for this since the time it takes to execute test suites varies.

```sh
--schema-check
```
An injected schemata should, when no mutant is activated, not affect the result
of the test suite. This option execute the test cases after the schemata has
been injected to see that all tests still pass. If it fails the specific
schemata is discarded. This is a good sanity check to have active because
schematan are still being developed and have been observed to sometimes
negatively affect the test suite.

```sh
--schema-log
```
Save the schematan, as they are used, to a file by their ID-number for later
analysis. This option is mostly intended for developers of dextool.

```sh
--max-alive <nr>
```
Run the mutation testing until `nr` alive mutants have been found. Intended to
be used when integrating mutation testing with pull requests to have an early
halting condition.

```sh
--schema-only
```
Only use schematan for the test phase. Depending on the operators this mean
that between 50-100% of the mutants can be tested pretty fast.

```sh
--schema-use
```
If schematan should be used. Dextool will start by trying to use all schematan
that have mutants that are in the worklist. When all schematan are consumed
dextool will fall back to the slower source code mutating.

```sh
--schemata-min-mutants
```
Minimum number of alive mutants that a schema must contain for it to be used.
This is the starting value of the filtering process. Each schema that fail will
increase the threshold because the tool assume that the probability of a schema
to fail compiling is related to how many that have already failed to compile.
This is to reduce the amount of wasted work (compiling invalid schemas).

```sh
--schema-parallel-mutants
```
How many mutants to test in parallel in a schema.

```sh
--use-early-stop
```
If dextool should stop executing the test suite as soon as it finds one failing
test case. The *precicion* of the reports containing sections about test cases
will be lower because dextool hasn't gathered complete information. But this is
usually not a problem and far offset by the significant reduction in execution
time that this option can achieve.

```sh
--max-runtime
```
To run mutation testing to completion can take a long time. This option
configures that dextool should terminate testing after the specified time.
This allows dextool to run for e.g. 3h, stop, generate a report and then
restart. It thus gives continues feedback of the progress.

```sh
dextool mutate test --max-runtime "1 hours 30 minutes 10 msecs"
```

```sh
--load-behavior
```
Running mutation testing is taxing on the IT infrastructure. This option
configures how to behave when the load goes above the threshold.
 * nothing : ignore, do nothing. The default behavior.
 * slowdown : stop testing when the load goes above the threshold.
 * halt : stop testing.

```sh
--load-threshold
```
The 15 minute loadavg threshold to control when the `--load-behavior` is
triggered. By default it is set to the number of virtual cores on the computer.

```sh
--metadata
```
Metadata parameter takes a json file as argument. It can be used for increasing testing priority for files included in the json structure.

# Configuration File

The template that is generated by
```sh
dextool mutate admin --init
```

try to be self explaining. This section is thus focused on explaining the
different categories (`[....]`).

## [workarea]

Configuration of the directories that dextool is allowed to change files in.

`root`: Defines the root directory that all phases of mutation testing will use.
 * the analyze phase will only store mutants that reside in the root or
   sub-directories.
 * the test phase will only mutate files that is inside the root.
 * the report will make all paths relative to the root.

`include`: See below.

`exclude`: A project may want to further restrict what directories/files should
be mutated inside the root. It could for example be so that the src and test is
inside the same root. To discover all available mutants, C++ templates, the
analyser must analyze test cases because templates are instantiated there. But
it is obviously so that the tests should not be mutated. By configuring this
option to `include=["src/*"]` it means that only the mutants inside
`{root}/src` are saved in the database. This can be combined with `exclude` to
remove e.g. files inside `src` for this example.

## [generic]

Generic options that affect all phases that. The most important to configure
here is the mutation operators to use (`mutants`). It affects what mutants are
saved in the database, which ones are mutated and reported.

## [analyze]

Options that affects the analyze phase.

`id_algo`: Configures what algorithm to use when generating unique IDs for
mutants.
The default algorithm is `strict`. If any code in a file is changed
then all mutants in that file are re-tested. The *diff* for testing is
basically per file. The problem is obvious for this because the most common
change is just a couple of lines in a file. This algorithm is *safe* but lead
to unnecessary testing of mutants.
The second algorithm is `relaxed`. It is *scope* aware. Mutants are unique
within a file and within a scope. Only mutants within a scope are re-tested if
the source code in the scope is changed. This thus basically mean that the
algorithm works like "git diff". It only test mutants in scopes that have
changed. It makes it faster to test a code change.

## [schema]

Schemata is a technique that inject multiple mutants at the same time in the
SUT with code that allow them to be toggled one at a time. This make it
possible to compile once and have hundreds of mutants in the binary at the same
time. In short it cuts down on the compile+link time. It is highly recommended
to enable this option because mutation testing becomes 50-10000% times faster
(depending on the test suite runtime).

`use`: activate use of schematan.

`runtime`: The option `inject` mean that dextool inject the runtime needed for
mutation testing in all roots or those specified by `inject_runtime_impl`. This
is a nice and automated process. If this doesn't work because you are running
on an embedded system and need a modified schema runtime, linking errors etc
then you can opt to use the `library` option. It means that you precompile the
runtime and manually link with the library. Dextool will do no magic.

`check_schemata`: This option check that there are no errors with the schema by
executing the test suite once, after the schema is injected. The test suite
should, if everything worked as expected, signal PASSED/no failure. If it
failed in any way it means that there is a bug in the schema generator and it
isn't just.

`mutants_per_schema`: The approximate max number of mutants a schema should
contain. Some compiles fail to compile when the source code is too big. This
allows you to control how many mutants are injected.

`min_mutants_per_schema`: Minimum number of mutants a schema must contain for it to be used.

`inject_runtime_impl`: Inject the runtime in only these files.

## [coverage]

An additional pass will be executed when either the program or the tests
changes. This pass instrument the source code to see which functions are
covered by the tests. Any mutants that is in a function that is not covered
will be marked as alive. It is because for the test suite to even have a chance
of killing a mutant it must execute the function/method the mutant reside in.
This option can greatly speed up the testing of all mutants.

`use`: activate use of coverage.
It is strongly recommended to also track the test files such that the coverage
is automatically updated when the tests are changed (`generic.test_paths`).

`runtime`: The option `inject` mean that dextool inject the runtime needed for
mutation testing in all roots or those specified by `inject_runtime_impl`. This
is a nice and automated process. If this doesn't work because you are running
on an embedded system and need a modified schema runtime, linking errors etc
then you can opt to use the `library` option. It means that you precompile the
runtime and manually link with the library. Dextool will do no magic.

`inject_runtime_impl`: Inject the runtime in only these files.

## [database]

Database options.

## [compiler]

Options for the compiler such as extra flags to add or if a specific compiler
should be used instead of the one found in the `compile_commands.json` file.

`use_compiler_system_includes`: Extract all system includes from this compiler
instead of the one that is used in `compile_commands.json`. This is important
for e.g. cross compilers or older versions of GCC. A cross-compiler may point
to a C++ stdlib that isn't compatible with clang which would lead to a total
analysis failure. By *fooling* dextool to instead derived the system includes
from another compiler it is still possible to complete the analysis phase.

## [compile_commands]

Configuration of which `compile_commands.json` to use and how it should be
filtered.

`filter`: Use to remove flags that aren't compatible with clang such as `-W`
that only exist in GCC.

`skip_compiler_args`: Sometimes the first argument isn't the compiler. Dextool
need to know where the compiler "start" in the argument list because the system
includes are extracted from the compiler.

## [mutant_test]

Configuration of the test phase. This contains the most options because it is
also the one that has to be highly flexible.

`build_cmd`: Program/script used to build the application. Will be called to
compile both the original program (sanity check) and to compile the program
each time a mutant is injected.

`test_cmd_dir`: The directory is analyzed for executables. All executables that
are found then used as test case binaries. This is a convenient option to use
when they are all in a directory easily accessible.

`test_cmd_dir_search`: How `test_cmd_dir` is scanned for executables. Default
is to scan recursively but if this is a problem because there are e.g.
executable test data in sub directories the search mode can be changed to
`shallow`.

`test_cmd_dir_flag`: The flags here are used when executing binaries found via
`test_cmd_dir`. It is a convenient way of inactivating test cases in e.g.
Googletest.

`test_cmd`: If `test_cmd_dir` isn't suitable to use then this allows a manual
specification of the test binaries to execute together with, for the complex
cases, also specifying the flags to use per command.

`test_cmd_timeout`: Timeout of the test suite. This should normally **not** be
used. The default for dextool is to use a dynamic timeout that is derived by
measuring the test suites execution time together with a timeout-re-test
algorithm that re-execute timeouts together with increasing until no visible
change is detected. By setting this option dextool will **not** derive the
execution and will **not** use the timeout-re-test algorithm.

`build_cmd_timeout`: Configures a timeout for the build command. Use if the
build system can have intermittent lockups. The default is one hour.

`analyze_cmd`: Configures dextool to call this command to analyze the output of
the test suite to derived which test cases that exist, which ones that killed a
mutant and stability. The intended use case of this option is embedded
developers that use a minimal, custom test framework.

`analyze_using_builtin`: Use one or more of the builtin test framework
analyzers.

`detected_new_test_case`: A programs test suite that evolve over time may add
new test cases. This control how dextool will behave when it finds a new test
case. Either just ignore it or re-test all mutants that has survived (alive) to
see if the new test cases kill any of those that previously survived.

`detected_dropped_test_case`: Configures what dextool should do with the stored
information about a test case which it detects has been removed. Either just
leave it as it is or remove it. If the test case is removed all mutants that
the test case uniquely killed will be reset to `unknown` statues which will
trigger them to be re-tested.

`oldest_mutants`: The tool is unaware of the tests and if they have changed.
This is a configuration that tell the tool to re-test old mutants to see if
anything has changed in the test suite. The re-test, if activated, of old
mutants will only be done if there is nothing else to be done (the worklist is
empty).

`oldest_mutants_percentage`: Instead of hard coding a specific number of
mutants this allows you to configure a percentage of the total number to test.
This is the recommended way of configuring re-test of old mutants because then
you do not need to tune it when the SUT grow in size.

`parallel_test`: How many test binaries to run in parallel. If this option
isn't set then dextool mutate will run as many as you have virtual cores.

`use_early_stop`: The tool will stop executing test binaries as soon as one
reports failed. This is useful if you have many test binaries because it cuts
down on the test time. It is highly recommended to activate this option, which
is why it is active by default. Note though that the report section
`dead_test_case` and `overlap` will be less accurate because, obviously, not
all test binaries are executed for each mutant but rather a subset. This can be
alleviated somewhat by executing tests in random order. For google test this is
`--gtest_shuffle`.

`continues_check_test_suite`: This option activates a test suite check that is
ran periodically. It try to execute the test suite with zero mutants. If it
ever fails it means that there is something wrong with the computer the tool is
executing on and it will revert the previously gathered results and stop. This
can happen when e.g. the disk becomes full.

`continues_check_test_suite_period`: Configures how often to run the check,
every X mutant.

`test_cmd_checksum`: Compare the checksum of the test binaries with and without
a mutant injected to determine which test binaries need to be executed. Only
those that are different are executed because well, those where affected by the
mutant. If no test binary is changed when the mutant is injected then the
mutant is an equivalent mutant because the compiler managed to "optimize away"
the modification. This option is recommended to activate because it cuts down
on the test time and allows the tool to find equivalent mutants. But to use it
it means that all `test_cmd` must binaries, it can not be e.g. "make test".
This is obvious when you think about it because "make test" is never changed
when a mutant is injected.
This option also activate a checksum table of `test_cmd` - mutation
status. If the checksum of the `test_cmd` match what is already known then that
mutation status is used instead.

`max_test_cmd_output`: Limits the number of mbytes captured from the `test_cmd`
executions. The limit is per `test_cmd`. This is used to prevent e.g.
`test_cmd`s that execute in an infinite loop and spew out Gbyte of output from
consuming all the available memory which lead to a crash of the plugin.  The
default limit is 10 Mbyte. It should be enough for most reasonable `test_cmd`s.

`max_mem_usage_percentage`: Limit the max used memory. The limit is global for
the host thus includes all programs that are executed. If the limit is reached
the tool will start terminating `test_cmd`s to reduce the memory usage. A
terminated `test_cmd` is marked as timeout. This is to re-test them later on to
be **really** sure that they actually result in the host running out of memory
and thus isn't a fluke.

## [report]

Configuration of the generated reports.

`style`: The default report style to use when none is specified via the CLI.

`sections`: An array of the default sections to use when none are specified via
the CLI.

`high_interest_mutants_nr`: The number of mutants to show in the high interest
mutants section.

# Resources

The runtime resources that are installed together with the tool such as the
header that is injected for schemata can be overridden. Dextool mutate searches
the following directories, in this order, for the resources:

 * `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`/dextool/mutate
 * `which dextool`/data/mutate
 * `dirname $(which dextool)`/data/mutate
 * `$XDG_DATA_DIRS`/dextool/data/mutate

A user that wants to change the injected schemata header would for example add
the `schemata_header.c` to `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/.local/share/dextool/data/mutate`
