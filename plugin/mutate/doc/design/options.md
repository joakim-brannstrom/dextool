# Options and flags
partof: DOC-plugin_mutate

This document aims to improve usability for the *Mutate* plugin in Dextool by explaining flags and options in more detail. The following sections are divided into the current existing commands for *Mutate*.

The flags for the different commands will be listed in the following format:

- *--flag-long-version [-flag-short-version] : Description*
    - *input_example*

**Note:** Several of the commands listed below can be set in the configuration-file as well. It is recommended to generate an *.toml*-file and set the corresponding fields in that file instead of having long chains of commands to execute in the terminal (it is usually more simple that way, reduces clutter in the terminal and increase usability for coming test sessions). The information listed below can also be viewed by executing *dextool mutate --help* in a terminal window, but with a shorter and less detailed explanation.

## General
*This options are general and can be used for all the commands in Mutate.*


- --config [-c] : Load configuration (default: .dextool_mutate.toml). Can be used if another project contains a configuration-file which the users wants to reuse.


- --db : Specify which sqlite3 database to use for the mutation testing (default: dextool_mutate.sqlite3). This option could be used when several databases exists for i.e. different versions of the code, or simply because the user have chosen to create several databases for result.


- --out : Path used as the root for mutation/reporting of files (default: .).


- --help [-h] : Display the help information in terminal window (less detailed). By writing, for example, *dextool mutate analyze --help*, the user will display the help for the analyze command.

## Admin
*Admin-mode for the plugin. Is used to execute administrative commands and to initialize/setup mutation testing for a project.*


- --dump-config : Dump the detailed configuration in the terminal. Could be used to create and setup your own configuration-file.


- --init : Create an initial configuration to use in the current workspace. This command is used when the mutation testing is setup for a specific project the first time.


- --mutant : Mutants to operate on.
    - *any* : Any (all) mutants are generated.
    - *ror* : Relational Operator Replacement.
    - *rorp* : Relational Operator Replacement (Pointer).
    - *lcr* : Logical Connector Replacement.
    - *lcrb* : Logical Connector Replacement (Bit-wise).
    - *aor* : Arithmetical Operator Replacement.
    - *uoi* : Unary Operator Insertion.
    - *abs* : Absolute Value Insertion.
    - *sdl* : Statement Deletion.
    - *cor* : Conditional Operator Replacement.
    - *dcc* : Decision/Condition Coverage.
    - *dcr* : Decision/Condition Requirement.


- --operation : Administrative operation to perform
    -   *none* : Performs no operation.
    -   *resetMutant* : lets the user reset all mutants with the status/state specified with *--status* to the status specified with *--to-status*.
    -   *removeMutant* : Remove all mutants of the specified kind (*--mutant*) from the database.
    -   *removeTestCase* : Remove all test cases that match the supplied regex.
    -   *markMutant*: Mark a mutant with a specific status and provide a rationale. Will both mark the mutant in mutationStatusTable and in a separate table.


- --test-case-regex : Regular expression to use when removing test cases.


- --status : Change mutants with this status/state to the value specified by *--to-status-flag*. The typical usage of this option is to reset the mutants with *alive* status to *unknown* in order to conduct mutation testing again after the test suite has been extended.
    - *unknown* : Mutants that is either untested or caused unknown errors when trying to execute compilation script.
    - *killed* : Mutants that were detected by the test suite (one or more tests failed).
    - *alive* : Mutants that were not detected by the test suite (all tests passed).
    - *killedByCompiler* : Invalid mutants generated that caused the compilation of the project to fail.
    - *timeout* : Mutants that timed out during test suite execution.


- --to-status : Reset mutants to status/state (default: unknown). (see *--status*).
    - *unknown* : Mutants that is either untested or caused unknown errors when trying to execute compilation script.
    - *killed* : Mutants that were detected by the test suite (one or more tests failed).
    - *alive* : Mutants that were not detected by the test suite (all tests passed).
    - *killedByCompiler* : Invalid mutants generated that caused the compilation of the project to fail.
    - *timeout* : Mutants that timed out during test suite execution.


-   --id : Specify a specific mutant by Id.


-   --rationale : Provide a rationale for marking a mutant.

## Analyze
*Analyze-mode for the plugin. Is used to find mutation points in the project by traversing the AST for the eligible files. Will write results into a database that will be used later for testing and generation of mutants.*


- --compile-db : Retrieve compilation parameters from a specific compilation-database. This can be used if the projects contains specific compilation-databases for ex. compilation targets or environments.

- --restrict : Restrict analysis to files in this directory tree (default: .). This option can be used to make sure that mutations are not generated for specific files outside a specific directory tree. This option together with a generated compilation-database specified with *--compile-db* lets *Mutate* iterate over every file in the project, and compares their paths to the *restricted area*.


## Generate
*Generate-mode for the plugin.*


- --restrict : Restrict analysis to files in this directory tree (default: .). This option can be used to make sure that mutations are not generated for specific files outside a specific directory tree.

## Test
*Test-mode for the plugin. Injects a mutant into the source code, compiles the project to see if the mutants was valid and then executes the test suite in order to analyze whether or not the test suite detected the mutant. Will also check if the mutant caused an infinity-loop, or simply took longer time than usual, by utilizing the timeout-implementation.*


- --build-cmd : Program/script used to build the application. Will be called upon by *Mutate* in order to compile the application (both for sanity-checks and when a mutant has been injected in the code).


- --dry-run : Do not write data to the filesystem.


- --mutant : Kind of mutation to test.
    - *any* : Any (all) mutants are generated.
    - *ror* : Relational Operator Replacement.
    - *rorp* : Relational Operator Replacement (Pointer).
    - *lcr* : Logical Connector Replacement.

This option can be used to make sure that mutations are not generated for specific files outside a specific directory tree. This option together with a generated compilation-database specified with *--compile-db* lets *Mutate* iterate over every file in the project, and compares their paths to the *restricted area*.


- --test-cmd : Program/script used to run the test suite. Will be called upon by *Mutate* in order to test the application (both for sanity-checks and when a mutant has been injected in the code).


- --test-case-analyze-builtin : Builtin analyzer of output from testing frameworks to find failing test cases. Can be used in order to specify a framework used for testing and letting Dextool analyze the output from test-results according to that framework.
    -   *gtest* : Analyzes the test case result according to the Googletest-format.
    -   *ctest* : Analyzes the test case result according to the Ctest-format.
